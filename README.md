# Raspberry Pi Display

## Development

For a rapid development with quick feedback loops it is recommended to set up a remote server in PyCharm.
Create a new sftp connection under `Settings > Build, Exec., Depl. > Deployment`.
Don't forget to also configure the correct local/remote folder mapping.

When successfully configured you can sync files via upload/download under `Tools > Deployment` (or right click menu).

To test your changes create a new remote session (`View > Tool Windows > Terminal > New Predefined Session`).
